% Methodology or Algorithm or Theoretical know-how or steps to run your code/simulations
% Please delete the below lines and enter details for this assignment/homework

    The commands to compile and run the code are specified in a \texttt{Makefile}. The details are 
    explained below.

\subsubsection{PART 1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{make process}: Reads the traces and prepares an input format for simulator. 
\textbf{Note:} The miss traces MUST be present in a directory named \textit{traces} in the root
folder.

\item \texttt{make simulate}: Compiles and runs the cache simulator for \textbf{part 1}.\\L2, L3
cache hits and misses are printed in stdout.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} \texttt{make part1} runs the above two commands together.

\subsubsection{PART 2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{make fa-lru}: Run the simulator for Fully associative L3 cache with LRU cache
replacement policy.

\item \texttt{make fa-min}: Run the simulator for Fully associative L3 cache with Belady's MIN
cache replacement policy.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} \texttt{make part2} runs the above two commands together.
